# Ethical-Hacking-Report
This is a simple Ethical Hacking Report that I made as a final project in Internshala Ethical Hacking Training. 
It is a simple report which is generated by performing ethical hacking practices on Internshala's demo website.
In this training, I have learned the  ** basics of information security, computer network and web development,
VAPT of information gathering and some important vulnerabilities in the OWAPS top 10, automating VAPT, 
and documenting and reporting vulnerabilities **.
